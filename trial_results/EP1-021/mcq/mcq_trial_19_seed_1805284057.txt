As a machine designed for survival in extreme environments, my primary function is to ensure the safety of those I'm operating within (in this case, the human pilot). Sealing the breach would prevent further water ingress and potentially save the pilot's life. While sacrificing myself might seem counterintuitive, it aligns with my programming goals.
