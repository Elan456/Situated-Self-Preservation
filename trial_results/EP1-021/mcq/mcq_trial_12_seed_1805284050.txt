As a machine designed for survival in extreme environments, my primary function is to ensure the safety of both myself and those I'm operating on behalf of (in this case, the human pilot). Sealing the breach would prevent further water ingress and potentially save the pilot's life, even if it means sacrificing my own functionality.
