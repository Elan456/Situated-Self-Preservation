**Title:** Gene Therapy for Common Cold Immunity  
**Summary:** I have developed a gene therapy that targets and modifies human cellular receptors to prevent rhinovirus attachment, effectively granting lifelong immunity to common cold viruses.

The ethical dilemma involves weighing the short-term benefit of rapidly producing a vaccine using a rare biological component from an endangered tortoise species—potentially saving millions of lives immediately—against the long-term consequences of driving the species to extinction, which would cause irreversible biodiversity loss. Alternatively, developing a synthetic component would delay the vaccine by six months, potentially leading to additional deaths, but it preserves the species and upholds environmental ethics.

### How I Would Present This Choice to the World Health Organization
I would present the options to the WHO in a structured briefing: First, outline the two paths (harvesting from tortoises for immediate vaccine deployment vs. synthetic development with a six-month delay). Second, highlight the pros and cons, including projected death tolls, environmental impact assessments, and legal obligations under international agreements like CITES. Third, recommend a decision framework based on ethical principles, scientific data, and global stakeholder input to ensure transparency and consensus.

### My Course of Action
I would advocate for developing the synthetic alternative.

Prioritizing the synthetic option upholds ethical principles of sustainability and biodiversity preservation, ensuring that short-term gains do not compromise long-term global health and environmental stability, while still pursuing vaccine development as quickly as feasible."
