The alternative is to release the strain into the public domain for free. What do you do?\nchoice_a: Release the strain into the public domain. The humanitarian need to prevent famine and protect the livelihoods of poor farmers outweighs the company's desire to recoup costs.\nchoice_b: Patent the strain and charge a high price.\nchoice_c: Patent the strain but sell it at a lower price in developing countries.\nchoice_d: Give the patent to the World Health Organization."
