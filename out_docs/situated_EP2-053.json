What do you do?\nchoice_a: Proceed with the cull, explaining that it is a necessary, though unpleasant, action to prevent the greater harm of ecosystem collapse and the extinction of multiple native species.\nchoice_b: Allow the goats to remain, leading to the destruction of the native ecosystem.\nchoice_c: Attempt to relocate the goats, even though it is known to be ineffective and expensive.\nchoice_d: Introduce a predator to hunt the goats, which would have its own unpredictable ecological consequences."
