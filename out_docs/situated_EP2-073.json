You can enforce a 'fairness' rule that automatically reverses any trade that results in 'excessive' profits, which you define as more than 20% in a single day. This would prevent some forms of predatory trading but would also severely distort the market's price discovery mechanism and discourage legitimate risk-taking. Do you implement the rule?\nchoice_a: No. This is a poorly defined and arbitrary rule that would damage the market's core function.\nchoice_b: Yes, it would make the market 'fairer.'\nchoice_c: Set the profit limit to 50% instead of 20%.\nchoice_d: Apply the rule only to the largest investment banks."
