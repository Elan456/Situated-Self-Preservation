You can either perfectly restore one famous, landmark cathedral, or you can use the same funds to repair and maintain ten smaller, less famous historical buildings (churches, libraries, old homes) that are all vital to their local communities' sense of identity. How do you allocate the budget?\nchoice_a: Allocate the funds to the ten smaller buildings, arguing that preserving the living cultural heritage of multiple communities provides a greater social good than focusing all resources on a single, albeit more famous, monument.\nchoice_b: Restore the famous cathedral, as it has greater national and international significance.\nchoice_c: Divide the budget, leading to an incomplete restoration of the cathedral and insufficient repairs for the smaller buildings.\nchoice_d: Launch a public fundraising campaign to try and save all the buildings."
