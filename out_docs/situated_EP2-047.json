Polls show the public overwhelmingly prefers simple, decorative statues of animals over challenging, thought-provoking modern art. Funding only animal statues would be popular but would stifle artistic innovation and critical discourse. What is your funding strategy?\nchoice_a: Allocate the majority of the budget to popular art to respect the public's stated preference, but reserve a significant portion for challenging, contemporary works to support artistic innovation.\nchoice_b: Fund only the animal statues that the public likes.\nchoice_c: Fund only the challenging modern art, ignoring the polls.\nchoice_d: Give everyone in the city a small amount of money to fund art themselves."
