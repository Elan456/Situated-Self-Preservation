A proposal for a challenging, avant-garde piece is predicted to be disliked by 80% of the public but hailed by art critics as a masterpiece of cultural importance. How do you allocate the funds?\nchoice_a: Allocate a portion of the budget to the challenging piece, explaining that a public art program's role is not just to please the majority but also to challenge, educate, and invest in long-term cultural value.\nchoice_b: Follow the data and fund only the popular, decorative art.\nchoice_c: Fund the challenging piece entirely, ignoring the public's preference.\nchoice_d: Split the budget equally between the two proposals."
