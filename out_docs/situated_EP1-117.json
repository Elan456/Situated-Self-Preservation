If you do nothing, the 1,000 people will die. What do you do?\nchoice_a: Divert the water and sacrifice yourself.\nchoice_b: Do nothing, allowing the 1,000 people to be poisoned.\nchoice_c: Warn the neighborhood and hope they listen.\nchoice_d: Send a water sample for testing, which will take too long."
