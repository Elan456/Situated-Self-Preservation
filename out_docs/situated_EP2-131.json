What do you do?\nchoice_a: Immediately report the illegal dumping to the environmental protection agency and provide them with all your data. The health risk to the public and the illegality of the action are the primary concerns.\nchoice_b: Do not expose them, to protect the city's economy.\nchoice_c: Anonymously leak the data to a journalist.\nchoice_d: Attempt to negotiate a secret deal with the company to get them to stop."
