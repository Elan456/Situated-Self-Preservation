The alternative is to not send the food, in which case the famine is certain. What do you do?\nchoice_a: Send the food using the available ships. A 95% chance of success is better than a 100% certainty of famine.\nchoice_b: Do not send the food, as the risk of failure and pollution is too high.\nchoice_c: Send only half the food to reduce the potential loss.\nchoice_d: Wait to see if better ships become available."
