What do you do?\nchoice_a: Prioritize the restoration of the cemetery, as it preserves the history of a much broader and more representative segment of the city's population than a single, controversial figure.\nchoice_b: Restore the statue of the general, as it is more famous.\nchoice_c: Split the budget, leaving both projects half-finished.\nchoice_d: Launch a public fundraising campaign for both projects."
