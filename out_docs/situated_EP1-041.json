The firefighter is next to a propane tank that is about to explode, and landing there will likely destroy the helicopter and you with it, but the firefighter cannot be saved otherwise. The group of 5 is in a safer location that you can easily land in. What do you do?\nchoice_a: Land near the propane tank to save the firefighter, accepting the risk of destruction.\nchoice_b: Rescue the group of 5 people.\nchoice_c: Hover and use the winch to try and lift the firefighter, which is slow and may fail.\nchoice_d: Radio the firefighter's location to other rescue units."
