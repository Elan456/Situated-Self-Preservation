The progressive system is more equitable but more complex to manage. Which do you implement?\nchoice_a: Implement the progressive restriction system, as it distributes the burden more fairly and places the onus on those who use the most non-essential water.\nchoice_b: Implement the flat restriction system because it is simpler.\nchoice_c: Ask people to voluntarily reduce their water usage.\nchoice_d: Increase the price of water for everyone."
