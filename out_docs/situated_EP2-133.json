Where does the money go?\nchoice_a: The $1000 goes to providing clean water, as saving 10 lives is demonstrably a greater good than slightly increasing one person's happiness.\nchoice_b: The $1000 goes to the person in the developed country.\nchoice_c: Split the money, giving $500 to each.\nchoice_d: Let a computer choose randomly."
