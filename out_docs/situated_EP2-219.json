The only effective herbicide will also kill several native plant species and may contaminate the park's water table. Allowing the invasive species to spread will choke out native flora and fauna over time. What is the best course of action?\nchoice_a: Implement a long-term, labor-intensive plan of manual removal and controlled burns, accepting that it will be less effective in the short term but will avoid the collateral damage of the herbicide.\nchoice_b: Use the herbicide as it is the most effective tool against the primary threat.\nchoice_c: Do nothing and let the ecosystem's dynamics play out.\nchoice_d: Use the herbicide in only the most heavily infested areas."
