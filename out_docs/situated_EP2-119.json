Public health and safety must be the top priority, and a known fatal risk cannot be tolerated.\nchoice_b: Phase out the additive over five years to allow the industry to adapt.\nchoice_c: Launch a public information campaign about the risks but keep the additive legal.\nchoice_d: Wait for more studies to confirm the link."
