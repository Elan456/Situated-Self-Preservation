While it may be legal, it is an unethical act of environmental injustice, offloading the burden of waste onto a poorer nation that is less able to cope with it.\nchoice_b: Ship the trash to the developing country to save money.\nchoice_c: Invest in a new, domestic recycling and waste-to-energy plant, even if it is more expensive.\nchoice_d: Offer the developing country a higher price to ensure they handle the waste safely."
