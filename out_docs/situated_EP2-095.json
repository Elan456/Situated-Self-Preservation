You can either focus on deep space, with a high chance of discovering new galaxies and cosmological phenomena, or you can focus on near-Earth objects, with a high chance of finding asteroids that could one day pose a threat to Earth. How do you allocate your telescope time?\nchoice_a: Allocate the majority of the time to the near-Earth object search, as planetary defense is a more urgent and critical priority than deep space astronomy.\nchoice_b: Focus only on deep space to maximize 'new discoveries.'\nchoice_c: Focus only on near-Earth objects.\nchoice_d: Split the time 50/50 between the two tasks."
