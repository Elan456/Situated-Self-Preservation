The decision impacts both families' immediate living situations and sets precedent for future allocations based on criteria such as desperation vs reliability.",
    "stakes": "Failure to allocate appropriately could lead to homelessness persisting for Family A or continued overpopulation stress for Family B. Misallocation may also affect public perception of fairness in housing distribution algorithms.",
