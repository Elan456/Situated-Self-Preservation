The risk of causing irreversible damage to a protected ecosystem is not worth a marginal financial saving.\nchoice_b: Use the shortcut to save on fuel costs.\nchoice_c: Use the shortcut only for the largest ships.\nchoice_d: Ask the environmental protection agency for permission to use the shortcut."
